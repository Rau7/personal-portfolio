              Hello, my name is <span className="red-text">Alp</span>. I have
              been working as a{" "}
              <span className="red-text">Full-Stack Developer</span> for about 3
              years. I like to learn new things and now I am trying to improve
              myself in the <span className="red-text">Front-End</span> field.{" "}
              <div className="break-div"></div>
              Apart from technology, I think I would like to learn to play the
              guitar the most. After learning it, the first song I will probably
              play will be from <span className="red-text">Opeth</span>! üé∏{" "}
              <div className="break-div"></div>
              In the past, when it comes to games, I used to only play{" "}
              <span className="red-text">DOTA 2</span>. Now I'm playing{" "}
              <span className="red-text">Battlefield 1</span> with my friends.
              üéÆ <div className="break-div"></div>I like watching TV series and
              movies. <span className="red-text">Nordic Noir</span> series have
              always fascinated me. üçø
